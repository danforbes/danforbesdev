I'm a software engineer 🤓 who loves to help other people learn how they can use technology to make
their lives better 🚀 and even how we can all work together to use technology to make the world a
better place. Before getting my computer science degree from the
[University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) 🤘 in 2013, I received a bachelor's degree
from the [Culinary Institute of America](https://www.ciachef.edu/) 😋 in Hyde Park, New York, where
I studied the craft of hospitality and learned the value of world-class customer service. While at
CIA, I had the opportunity to serve as a tutor for a 6-week long intensive wine 🍾 course, which is
where I discovered my passion for education. Today, I use my unique combination of skills to support
technologies that allow people to interact with one another without the need to trust monolithic
centers of authority. In particular, I'm currently working to make the
[Kusama Network](https://kusama.network/) 🦜, a next-generation blockchain network, the most
supportive community for digital creators.

When I'm not talking about technologies like blockchain, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones
(especially my dogs 🐶), enjoying a variety of food & drink 🥂, exploring nature by hiking 🧗 or
riding my bike 🚴, and pursuing an interest in horticulture by growing all types of plants 🌱,
including orchids, succulents & cactus, ferns, begonias, and aquatic plants.
